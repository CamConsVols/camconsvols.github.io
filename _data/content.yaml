points:
- We do practical conservation work on Sundays in Nature Reserves around Cambridge. You are welcome to join us.
- We do things like raking reeds & hay, cutting scrub, laying hedges, coppicing woodland, maintaing fences and removing invasive species.
- We work with charities like BCN Wildlife Trust & RSPB and smaller local organisations to implement their habitat management plans and encourage the wildlife that's important on their sites.
- Some of us are wildlife experts; some aren't. Some of us are skilled; some aren't. Some of us talk a lot; some don't. Some of us come out every week; some don't. We all enjoy a day in the countryside with like minded people. You'll fit right in.
- We don't use noisy, dangerous power tools. Sometimes we have a bonfire.
- We have a wood burning kettle and provide tea, coffee, squash and biscuits. Bring your own lunch.
- Wear strong footwear: walking boots, work boots or wellies if it's wet.
- Wear something suitable for being outside all day that you don't mind getting dirty or maybe torn. 
- We go to the pub once a month and usually have a walk or a resurant meal too.
- We have an email list, an online calendar and a Facebook page. We try to keep them in sync.
- We don't charge you - we charge the organisations we work for a small amount to cover our travel and equipment expenses.
